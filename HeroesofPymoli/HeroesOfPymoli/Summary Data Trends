My first thought about this data set is concerning the overall revenue, one of the first tasks accomplished in the analysis. 
This company does not make very much money off of online gaming purchases alone, and this is most likely due to the cost
of each of the additional items. Popularity of the game itself is of course a factor; naturally, if the game becomes more
popular, more folks are joining, more for fee upgrades available, more folks willing to spend extra cash. However, Heroes of 
Pymoli is seemingly still pretty new, and therefore not making much hard cash on supplementary purchase items. The number of 
unique items is impressive though, and I hope that the game develops more unique items with a higher ticket price to boost
revenue. An obvious trend to this data is the gender skew, and one wonders just why it seems only men are interested in this
type of game. Is it marketed towards a male audience? Is it distasteful or does it portray gender in a way such that cis women
are uninterested? Or is this just due to the fact that more often than not, men are more willing to spend their money on video
game upgrade items? Whatever may be causing the trend, it's significant. Out of almost 600 players, 84% of them are men. The last 
interesting statistic of this game is just how much money a certain age group spends. It seems that folks in the 20-24 age range 
spend several times more than their younger and older counterparts. This may be due to the fact that this age group is 
beginning to make more money in their early 20's as opposed to their late teenage years, but they aren't as financially responsible
as folks typically are in their late 20's and beyond.
